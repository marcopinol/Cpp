Classes are declarations of new data types, which can contain data (data members) and functions (member functions / methods).

An Object is an instantiated class, for example:

(theorical example)

class Person{

	 float height; --> data (data member)
	 int age; --> data (data member)

	 void talk(){...} --> method (function member)
}

Person p --> this is an object (a instantiated class)
